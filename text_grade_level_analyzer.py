#  Lab 7: WordFrequency Enhanced With Reading Level Calculation of the text

# This program practices file i/o, error handling, and functions
# Receives a .txt file as input, processes the text eliminating punctuation
# and eventually sorting the words into a dictionary listing the number of occurrences
# for each word. The text is further analyzed for reading level using the Flesh-Kincaid
# grade level formula.
