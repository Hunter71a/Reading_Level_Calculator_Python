# Reading_Level_Calculator_Python
 Console based python program. User specified input text from a .txt file is analyzed using the Flesch-Kincaid algorithm for calculating the grade level of writing.
 
 This console version was a quick mock-up to experiment with the calculations and a GUI version might be implemented in the future.

A transcription of a Spongebob soliloquy and [Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address](https://github.com/Hunter71a/Reading_Level_Calculator_Python/blob/master/address.txt) are included for testing purposes.
